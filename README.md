# Java Project -> Assignment Scheduler (with MySQL)
In Engineering colleges students need to maintain their assignments for every subject.
This Project aims to manage assignments of the student according to its submission date.
At present, most students tend to just remember things which often leads to messing things up or forgetting their todos.

- The project has a User login section where user each user has his/her own login details.
Once the user has logged in he/she comes across an interface which consists of three options i.e. add, delete and show.

It gets removed from the database permanently.

Each user will be given with a separate username and password.
